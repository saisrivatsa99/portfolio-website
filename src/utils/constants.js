const about =[
    "I am a software engineer specializing in building full-stack applications and cloud computing, currently based in Virginia, USA. Before moving to the United States to pursue my Master's degree, I worked at Tata Consultancy Services as a developer for Apple, where I worked with various technologies and tools to build resilient backend systems. My fascination with software began at a young age through video games, sparking a lifelong passion for technology and its potential to create impactful experiences.",
    "My current focus is on developing end-to-end applications that are resilient, robust, and scalable. I take pride in creating software that is both visually appealing and highly functional. Designing systems to achieve this balance is something I thoroughly enjoy. Parallely, I am delving into the world of Large Language Models (LLMs) and AI to keep up with the latest industry trends.",    
    "When I'm not working on real-world applications or personal projects, I enjoy staying active through gaming, working out, and playing badminton. I also find inspiration in cooking new recipes, exploring hiking trails, and traveling to experience different cultures. Whether it's watching thought-provoking movies or tuning into podcasts and Spotify playlists, I always seek ways to broaden my perspective and keep my creativity flowing."
